## Computation Techniques Assignment 2

#### Description

The file _qrdecomp.py_ provides functions for performing QR decomposition (**qr_decomposition**) and finding eigenvalues
and eigenvectors by the QR iteration method (**get_eigenvalues_eigenvectors**). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors provided
by the second function come in pairs (i.e. the first eigenvector corresponds to the first eigenvalue and so on)

If run as a stand-alone module, it will output the eigenvalues along with the corresponding eigenvector to a given file

#### Usage instructions

Please find instructions on how to use the script by typing
`python qrdecomp.py -h`

#### Dependencies

In order for the script to run, only _numpy_ library is required.
